Description: A stack that will only grow to a certain point before transparently offloading data to physical files. Was developed to be used as a temporary spool for massive amounts of incoming heirarchical data that is received in no particular order, prior to pushing it into the DB. Also provides a 'collection'-type class for managing many stacks concurrently.
